Problem 1:
Will need to run 'npm install' in the correct directory to download the dependencies.
Use 'npm start' to run the application. new window should open to localhost:3000 for the quizapp.

Problem 2:
I tested my code using Google Chrome. I had to install a CORS extension to use the API to get data.
